The pituitary gland is divided into 3 lobes; the anterior, the posterior, and the intermediate lobe.

The anterior lobe is also called adenohypophysis and is responsible for secreting FSH, LH, ACTH, TSH, prolactin, GH & B-endorphin. It is derived from the oral ectoderm also known as Rathke pouch.

The hormones have an alpha subunit common to FSH, LH, TSH & BhCG.
The beta subunit determines hormone specificity.

The intermediate lobe secretes melanotropin stimulating hormone (MSH).

The posterior pituitary gland is also called neurohypophysis and it is responsible for secreting vasopressin (ADH or anti-diuretic hormone) and oxytocin.
These hormones are synthesized in the hypothalamus' supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei and transported to the posterior pituitary via the neurophysins which are carrier proteins.
The posterior pituitary gland is derived from the neuroectoderm.
